----------------------------------------------------------
Fixes
-----------------------------------------------------------
-	Fixed item boolean properties (such as dmg types) not copied into custom items
-	Fixed description check for MAGICPICKS filter (something affecting mage descriptions)

----------------------------------------------------------
Balance
-----------------------------------------------------------

0.12.6 (26th April 2025)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
-----------------------------------------------------------
-	Fixed seed generation problem with StatUpgradeManager. Seeds should work as expected again.
-	Created separate scout armor list for sidhe/bean scout cavalry.
-	Renamed/added a lot of pose ids.
-	Added missing unicorn_golden_barding_mount in mounts.txt.
-	Refactored armorUnit() code into smaller, more readable chunks.
-	Better SacredGenerator.java getPose() refactor to fix chanceincs.
-	Added #themeinc to not generate tier3 comslaves (they were breaking due to their equipment lists).
-	Reworked #weapon and #armor line writing into mod file:

	Ranged weapons are now written down in descending range order (i.e. longest range first).
	This is to combat a Dominions bug where if a shorter range weapon appears above, the unit
	will move all the way in range of that weapon even if it has better/longer range weapons.
	The most common example of this was Naga archers with their poison spit.

-	Refactored Custom Item Gen code to be more readable and reusable.

----------------------------------------------------------
Changes/Balance
-----------------------------------------------------------
-	Demonblood more common with blood nations
-	lesserhorror secondshape based on False Horror instead of Lesser Horror
-	Coral barding adds #poisonarmor 5 to mounts
-	Nerfed the cost and MR of the smaller Agarthan cavern wights
-	Buffed giant ichtyids:

	They will now always get the grab and swallow if they are using 1h weapons.
	Better nat prot, slightly better strength.

-	Tweaks to spellsinger and chorus communion chances:

	If the nation has other spellsingers, the chances of a mage getting spellsinger drastically increase.
	The Great Sorceress pretender is almost guaranteed to nations with spellsinger.
	Chorus spells (Glamour and Death) are much more likely if there are spellsingers.
	Added chorus #comslaves

-	Added #chanceinc to Cynocephalian elite troop poses to allow heroes.
-	Removed #baseitemslot feet 0 from mounted poses to give commanders feet.
-	Brought starting armies more in line with dom6 standards.
-	Nations now also get #guardunit and #guardcom. Rebalanced castle def.
-	Added shrink filter for sacreds, opposite of the larger filter.

----------------------------------------------------------
Balance
-----------------------------------------------------------
-	Tweaks to bakemono equipment (no bamboo rods, less plain clothing)

0.12.2 (9th March 2025)
----------------------------------------------------------
Fixes
-----------------------------------------------------------
-	Boreal and hoburg ghouls updated as per other ghoul changes.
-	Fixed burningone_offhand weapon ids.
-	Removed Tusk weapon from elephant monsters that were given to rider.
-	Fixed missing hashtags in some price_per_command #hp commands.
-	(oldmidgetwillow) Bakemono cavalry should now properly generate; fixes to their equipment looks.
-	Fixed abysian nightmare_plate_barding_mount mount id.
-	Fixed custom glaive_bone_mundane having wrong name.
-	Fixed polish() pass resolving custom item ids resulting in unresolved ones.

	When resolving the custom equipment of certain units during Unit.polish(), some of the items are marked
	with dependencies, such as #needstype rarm onehand and needstype offhand polearm.
	
	These dependencies are resolved once the id of said item is resolved, but they go on to potentially
	replace previously equipped items (in fact, they'll replace them even if the item already equipped
	fulfills that dependency for that slot!).
	
	The problem with this is that if those newly equipped items fell in slots that have already been
	passed over in the custom id equipment loop, their custom id will not be resolved after getting equipped,
	and the program will throw an exception when writing the unit's .dm lines. Said exception has also been
	made explicit and has had a clear debugging message added, so that whenever this happens it's easy to
	figure out which unit of which nation with which seed and which item caused the specific problem.

	As a bonus, the Item id resolution is now encapsulated into a static method of the Item class, which
	should make it easier for future debugging as well.

-	Replaced chariots' 2h weapons with proper versions.


----------------------------------------------------------
Balance
-----------------------------------------------------------
-	Removed #siegebonus +3 from castlemaster filter. Now units might get siege or castle defense,
	not both in one filter. If a unit generates with both separate filters, it can still have both.

-	Crab armor rcost increases; lowered chance of naked a bit.

-	Tweaked unit rating calculation for cap only chances further.

----------------------------------------------------------
Code
-----------------------------------------------------------
-	Added support for = operator within special commands like #chanceinc.

		For example, #chanceinc "command #demon =1" would overwrite the earlier unit's #basechance to be
		equal to 1 if the unit is a demon.

		Currently, a #chanceinc with a modifier of 1, without any operator (like + or -) is treated by
		default like an addition, so a #chanceinc "command #demon 1" means "add 1 to the #basechance if
		this unit is also a demon", rather than setting its #basechance to 1 as the notation might suggest.

-	Added #power 1 to all sacred and elite filters for clarity (this is their default value).

-	Implemented #price_per_applied_filter.

		This allows to alter gold cost based on the number of filters of a given power already present on the unit. Not tested/used currently.

-	Added More missing pose ids.


0.12.1 (4th March 2025)
----------------------------------------------------------
Content
-----------------------------------------------------------
-	Pulled the new Cynocephalian race from LemoniceX

0.12.0 (4th March 2025)
----------------------------------------------------------
Content
-----------------------------------------------------------
-	Added Glamour Communion spells
-	Added barded variations of most mounts for most races (only some sprites have been updated, however).
	Some of these are aimed at giving certain nations an edge; i.e. Merrows can get higher quality fae barding.

-	Added some new custom mounts and/or bardings for certain races (black unicorns!).
-	Fixed sacredpower sliders to actually affect how much sacredpower elites can spend
-	Reworked the algorithm that spends sacredpower currency to be more consistent and documented:

		The number of filters a sacred can roll into is not capped by a number of filters,
		but rather a number of power, allowing for more possible outcomes (i.e. units with more filters,
		but lower power ones).

		Strength increases can now also be purchased with sacredpower (like hp, def, morale, enc before).

- 	Implemented a new setting slider, Stat Upgrade Distribution, which changes the algorithm used to spend
	sacredpower into buying more stat points:

		"Lower First" is how it used to be done; the spending prioritizes the cheapest/lowest stat increases.
		"Random Stats" picks a stat completely at random to upgrade, even if it's more expensive than others.
		This means that units have a chance to end up much more specialized than others.
		"Balanced" is a combination of the above, where it will give a better chance to upgrade cheaper stats,
		but the weighing is not a guarantee.
		"Random setting" will pick one of the above three algorithms at random every time it spends a unit's sacredpower.

-	Some new filters, some courtesy of geepope
-	Balance tweaks and content additions to some specific nations:

		Agarthan Cavernwights got a price increase and MR decrease.

		Dustwalkers got their upkeep doubled to be more akin to Nazca; powerful undead but hard to maintain.

		Ghoul nations got an MR increase, 5% regen, corpse eater, and cost increases to account for this. Should make them much more interesting.

		Crabmen's natural protection lowered for non-elites, also got chances to generate with lighter armor.

		Merrow cavalry should *always* generate with a charge-bonus, one-hit lance on top of other weapons.

		Foulspawn got multiple flavours of "corruptors". These are special commanders that can spawn crossbred units in different ways.
		For example, some are temple trainers, some are domsummoners, some are corpse reanimators, etc. They also got higher chances
		to include a special monster in their recruitment roster.

		Small bakemono got a cavalry template based on vaetti cavalry, and better chances to generate special commanders.


-	Non-chariot cavalry got their weapon lists reworked to not include 2-handed weapons, since these incur a -2 attack penalty
	in Dominions 6 which makes them mostly unuseable. Most of the removed weapons got replaced with custom cavalry versions.
	Chariots still need to have these replaced, since they also get the penalty.

-	Added Skilled Rider and Mobile Archer tags. The former following vanilla guidelines. The latter was given to amazons,
	vanaras, vaettis.

-	Added new name and description variations. Most of this content was AI-generated and curated.

-	Reworked the cap-only/rec-everywhere calculations completely. Some of this started through geepope's own survivability
	calculations that aimed to give some sacreds a better edge. Now these units have a survivability score from 0 to 1 assigned,
	as well as a unit rating calculated based on how many extra filters they rolled into, and both of these numbers are used to
	determine what chance the unit has to be cap-only. Both their survivability rating and the cap-only chance is now written into
	the mod file under each unit's header, for transparency.

-	Temporarily removed multiple rider monsters such as the Pygmy Mammoths. These need a broader rework of the codebase to properly
	generate them and support them after all the changes that Dominions 6 introduced to mounted units.

-	Hoburg vinemen are now functional, courtesy of oldmidgetwillow.

- 	Stat fixes

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
-	Reformatted data/mounts/mounts.txt file to be consistent.
-	Multiple template fixes (fire/poisonspewers on colossus clockwork, missing tags, etc.).
-	Fixed Foulspawn cavalry not accounting for mount costs.
-	Bakemono-sho now have names.
-	Fixed Ettin helmets (they only need 1 helmet equipped with how Dominions works, but both sprites are rendered).
	The #armor tag has a hardcoded limit of 3, so the Ettins with two #armor helmets were losing their shield as a result.
-	Fixed spells getting duplicated when assigned to nations (https://github.com/elmokki/nationgen/issues/1221)

- Pale ones and lizards significantly less likely to be naked since their high rec points makes this a lot worse than it had been
- Updated some documentation

0.7.0-RC3 (22nd of March 2018)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed very broken chanceinc handling that, among other things, gave some spells to nations that did not deserve them
- Fixed nation commands in racial themes not being processed (for example, Caelian subculture temperature preferences)

Content
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Minimal implementation of imperial nations; these are an incomplete WIP, but functional
- Custom missiles and armors updated to reflect range/damage changes and #magic tags on armor

0.7.0-RC2 (17th of March 2018)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed the id ranges the program is allowed to use to conform to Dominions 5

	- Added basic logical operators for probability modifiers
	- Please report if you find something unusually weird in equipment or names or such things that are chosen from lists.

- Added automatic calculation of recruitment point base cost for anything that lacks a definition
- Added support for wall defenders

Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- Recruitment points defined for most units
- New movement values defined for most units

0.7.0-RC1 (2nd of February 2018)
----------------------------------------------------------

This is the first release for Dominions 5 and just a very, very basic conversion. It utilizes the ability of Dom5 to automatically
convert some of the unit stats for Dom5 and there may be wonkiness due to this. Feedback is appreciated.

Databases are not updated to Dominions 5 yet. It is very unlikely that this would cause any issues for generation, however.

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- MOVED TO DOMINIONS 5 (though apart from flags everything should still work in Dom4 too)! 

Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- Dominions 5 flags

Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- Some graphic tweaks and fixes

- Hoburg-specific special commanders (lots of critter-herds)
- Big ugly crossbreeding results as recruitable monsters for FS nations (again; this was in before but was buggy)
- A few new limbs for FS
- Camel mounts and chariots; polar bear mounts; elk mounts; peryton mounts
- Ettinling demographic theme for ogres; pretty much just what the name implies (as with other ogres, no giants for now)
- Ghoul nations as an uncommon demographic theme for advanced humans; they're gold-recruitable following LA Ulm's example


0.6.23 (17th of July 2017)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed Zotz description misspecification causing crashes

0.6.22 (17th of July 2017)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- A huge pile of refactoring and optimization, by Freykin
- Added handling for #specifiedgcost and #specifieddescr to monster definitions

Content
----------------------------------------------------------

- Pygmy elephants and mammoths for hoburgs and vaettir, with regional variants

- Filter for Bloodguard-style berserking strong homesick elites, with fancy specific names
- "Troglotyid" cavefishmen demographic theme for ichtyids

----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed melee javelins and some other magic item weirdness

0.6.21b (24th of January 2017)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- A change to mage leadership pricing made mages super cheap. This revealed a slightly more widespread bug in how command arguments were handled.
- Nations should no longer get two or more nation themes of the same type (for example, cheaper AND more expensive temples)

----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------

- Reclimit on dustwalker chariots
- Serpentmen cost adjustments
- "Lesser Lamia" theme for Amazon nations
- Full-sized illithid (mindblasters, elite/sacred soldiers, mages) added to illithid nations - these may be unbalanced in either direction
- Void gates are more common if a nation has a lot of units with void sanity, and much more common if they have units with summoning skill


0.6.20 (29th of December 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- If there are nation restrictions, a counter will indicate how many were rejected
- Fixed a (potential) problem with how chanceinc parses command-related arguments

Content

- Fixed temperature preferences for hot/cold serpentmen
- Fixed typo messing up rat and rabbit tribal themes for vaetti nations
- Fixed bad offset on boreal human ghouls
- Made some "big guy" poses (among others) more likely to be picked when making heros
- Fish, horse, grub, rat, and elephant heads for size-3 foulspawn
- Formorian stat update to Dom4 standards; better stats for the little ones, but pricier
- Uncursed theme for fomorians, with accompanying two-eyed giants and little not-goat-heads
- Fir bolgs as a standalone race, although they'll be more common as a secondary race (poor fir bolgs)
- Austral theme for primates (markata/bandar/bandar colossi); yeti got a few extra things as well
- Initial limited implementation of hoburg giants (giant hoburgs?) as monsters for feral hoburgs. Probably totally unbalanced.


0.6.19 (18th of October 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Magic weapons weren't being stored in the weapon DB during generation, leading to weirdness

- Brown and red muuch shamblers and demographic themes
- Feather-bedecked cavemen mounts for occidental hoburgs
- Certain varieties of charioteers can have whips for weapons
- Tengu roster size fix
- A handful of new troop descriptions, sacred troop names, and national epithets
- Strabo's serpentmen added as a minor race. Visually they're based on lesser hydras, mechanically on herbivore lizards. There was a fair amount of clutter added onto the mostly-done race base Strabo provided, primarily in adding demographic and regional variations. Nonetheless, they're a bit flat with only infantry, scouts, and casters, and they may possibly be unbalanced as well. Archers, chariots, and more variety for mages would make for good additions at some point down the line.

----------------------------------------------------------

Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- A few more body parts for size-3 Foulspawn

- Nazca-style robes for Caelians and occidental hoburgs
- Poison/flaming/banefire weapons for dustwalker ranged troops, as well as limiting their melee weapons to the heavier one-handers; this may or may not balance out the high prices for lightly-armed archers
- Activated the austral and humanbred elephant variants that have been around forever but not used
- Added dynastic human elephant variants
- Some graphic minor fixes


0.6.17c (23rd of August 2016)

- Tweaked commander selection criteria to prioritize units that fill many of the commands that should be filled at once
- Tweaked commander leadership assignment so that animals/slaves may have reduced leadership/inspiration, offset by an increased chance for beastmaster/taskmaster
- Tweaked commander leadership assignment so "non-standard" leaders are more likely to get more and better leadership, and "normals" are slightly less likely
- Tweaked mage/priest leadership for units derived from "warrior-priest" archtypes
- Nation ids were handed to nations discarded by seeds. 
	- Many mods with strict restrictions were unplayable even if they had just a few nations due to nation ids being higher than the game allows.

- The .jar was compiled from earlier codebase or something else really weird happened.


0.6.16b (17th of July 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Foul spawn centaur graphics were generated completely wrongly
- Item dependencies are reset when original item is removed
	- For example: Archers generally get quivers with their bows. If the bow is for some reason removed, so is the quiver.
	- Mostly there to hopefully fix a fairly rare commander overlay bug: Item removal or replacement in general are fairly rare


0.6.16 (17th of July 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------

Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- Reanimation on priests tends to not result on higher average priest level

- Longdead chariots for dynastics
- Default theme for nations w/o explicit themesets is now a "techlevel" theme with tendencies to iron over bronze

- Clan-based Caelian pacyderm variants
- Gear overhaul for Caelians
- Fomorian gear split into bronze and iron
- "Dynastic" humans: living equivilant of dustwalkers, plus also undead dustwalkers too (they seem thoroughly materialistic in their desire to rebuild their ancient nations, so I see no problem with them operating on a gold economy)

- Random other stuff: a robe here, a name there, etc.

- Theme system: Races get random themes and you might end up with something like oriental advanced hoburgs or primitive slaver lizards. For most races there are just few themes with moderate to little effect. However, see content part.
- Preview drawing is back (but does have some limitations like now showing #copystatted special monsters, so do note that)
- Troop generation overhaul
- Troop themes: Similar to old rare troop templates but able to affect unit generation instead of being given to units afterwards. These allow stuff like militia, minor elites etc and are far more common than the old troop templates. Every nation should get at least one.
- Support for mage/sacred/etc themes for future ideas of random templates for those
- Monsters support custom sprites
- Troop and commander naming was entirely rewritten
- A good pile of new #chanceincs for content creation
- Documentation on some things has been updated
- Forts moved to a file for ability to affect their probabilities
- Hero gold costs are now zero
- Heroes shouldn't get chaos recruitment and similar stuff
- Fixed a bug where only the last #chanceinc per thing was applied. This changed massively on how some things are generated.
- Nation filters are a bit more common
- A lot of tweaking and bugfixes

According to github there has been net of 9990 lines of code and content definitions (probably more definitions than code) added between June 13 and July 13. Last version of the program was released at the end of May so this is not even everything. To give credit where it's due, pretty much all the content additions apart from some of the troop and commander name files have been made by Ealb. While I've written most of the new code, Ealb has written a lot of bugfixes and tweaks and even more importantly spotted a huge number of bugs that may have been there for years.

Hoburgs are really worth checking out now. They really got a great amount of love from Ealb and are even more amazing now than before.
