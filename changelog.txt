- Very basic Asmegir nations; graphics are Dom3- or Dom2-era, so they're a bit rough. Aesir for elite/sacred giant poses and T3 casters (Aes only ATM)
- Basic bakemono nations - all troops and most casters are -sho(rt) for the time being
- Basic gigante nations - no mounted units and only very basic themes; note these are moreso MA Phae gigantes than EA Mek gigantes
- Nordic ("boreal") human nations - these should eventually include Rus/Vanarus elements, but for now are just Midgard-/Utgard-style nations

0.7.0-RC9 (22nd of January 2019)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Priests are now much more common as the T2 PD commander - ~75% instead of ~10%. This is in keeping with Dom5 numbers. T1 priests remain scarce. No priest-mages yet, but that's the next logical step.
- Small, obscure bugfixes

Content
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Merrow nations, with themes - no archers, but some land/amphibious mounted units
- Imperial casters now have distinctive robes; they look a bit odd sometimes with default hats but we're getting there

0.7.0-RC8 (5th of November 2018)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------

- Some new commander & priest names

- Updated Formation Fighter to the Dom5 version of the command
- Added a "generic spy/assassin" pose that is an option for most humans, Abysians, lizards, and merrow (not that the
  latter are added yet); this may be expanded as it seems to work fairly well...


0.7.0-RC6 (25nd of April 2018)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Sacred pricing more flexible; notably, larger sacreds should cost a bit more

Content
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed missing secondshape for occidental hoburg cavemen mounts
- Some small graphic fixes
- Dantih balancing: -3 supply, maxage 75->120; str 24->20; PD/starting army amounts increased slightly

0.7.0-RC5 (22nd of April 2018)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Support for sacred custom weapons that cost more resources

0.7.0-RC4 (11th of April 2018)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed custom sacred missile flysprites
- Fixed custom sacred missiles getting #nostr instead of #bowstr
- Fixed some errors with conditional chanceinc commands
- Revised PD quantity formulas; there should be more consistent amounts of PD across nations with fewer extremely large numbers of very cheap units
- ~~Allow for more than two ranks of PD occasionally~~ Currently disabled because of serious error with the relevant mod commands

Content
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed NG-specific missiles getting #nostr instead of #bowstr

- Updated some documentation

0.7.0-RC3 (22nd of March 2018)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed very broken chanceinc handling that, among other things, gave some spells to nations that did not deserve them
- Fixed nation commands in racial themes not being processed (for example, Caelian subculture temperature preferences)

Content
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Custom missiles and armors updated to reflect range/damage changes and #magic tags on armor

0.7.0-RC2 (17th of March 2018)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed the id ranges the program is allowed to use to conform to Dominions 5
- Large rewrite of the probability modifier handling system
	- Added basic logical operators for probability modifiers
	- Please report if you find something unusually weird in equipment or names or such things that are chosen from lists.

- Added support for wall defenders

Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- Recruitment points defined for most units
- New movement values defined for most units

0.7.0-RC1 (2nd of February 2018)
----------------------------------------------------------

This is the first release for Dominions 5 and just a very, very basic conversion. It utilizes the ability of Dom5 to automatically
convert some of the unit stats for Dom5 and there may be wonkiness due to this. Feedback is appreciated.

Databases are not updated to Dominions 5 yet. It is very unlikely that this would cause any issues for generation, however.

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- MOVED TO DOMINIONS 5 (though apart from flags everything should still work in Dom4 too)! 

Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- Dominions 5 flags

- #chanceinc racetheme is much more robust
- Preview graphic flag inconsistency fixed


Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- Some graphic tweaks and fixes
- A bit more variety of weapons for Celtic nations
- Bandar and troglotyid thralls for illithid nations with appropriate secondary races
- Hoburg-specific special commanders (lots of critter-herds)
- Big ugly crossbreeding results as recruitable monsters for FS nations (again; this was in before but was buggy)
- A few new limbs for FS
- Camel mounts and chariots; polar bear mounts; elk mounts; peryton mounts
- Ettinling demographic theme for ogres; pretty much just what the name implies (as with other ogres, no giants for now)
- Ghoul nations as an uncommon demographic theme for advanced humans; they're gold-recruitable following LA Ulm's example


0.6.23 (17th of July 2017)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed Zotz description misspecification causing crashes
- Fixed a minor bug that resulted in some units such as minotaurs getting only partial descriptions.

0.6.22 (17th of July 2017)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- A huge pile of refactoring and optimization, by Freykin
- Added handling for #specifiedgcost and #specifieddescr to monster definitions
- Added handling for #additionalweaponslot to troop (not caster) pose definitions; this is much like #generateitem, but it happens late in generation and is less likely to be overridden
- Better unit finalizing for montag units
- Another round of double lance fixes
- Extra mages more common
- Montag PD support 

Content
----------------------------------------------------------

- Pygmy elephants and mammoths for hoburgs and vaettir, with regional variants
- Dwarf elephant cavalry (and cataphracts) for hoburgs

- Fixed overeating nephilim (1200/mo -> 120/mo)
- Cavalry/chariots no longer have feet slots, nor do serpentmen or purebred illithids
- New unit filters: growthpower, airshield, and overcharged for sacreds; airshield for mages
- A bunch of new flag graphics contributed by AlStar
- A miniscule number of other flag graphics
- Faster (giant) swan chariots

- Filters for reduced/increased mage/elite/sacred costs
- Filter for Bloodguard-style berserking strong homesick elites, with fancy specific names
- "Troglotyid" cavefishmen demographic theme for ichtyids
- Nagas added as a full race; note that (for now) these are humble nagas w/o leg envy, so their mages don't shapechange

0.6.21c (25th of January 2017)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed melee javelins and some other magic item weirdness

Content

0.6.21b (24th of January 2017)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- A change to mage leadership pricing made mages super cheap. This revealed a slightly more widespread bug in how command arguments were handled.
- Nations should no longer get two or more nation themes of the same type (for example, cheaper AND more expensive temples)


0.6.21 (24th of January 2017)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- If AND ONLY IF there are nation restrictions, a counter will indicate how many were rejected
- Fixed a bug where improved weapons for sacreds weren't copying the tags of what they were derived from

- Reclimit on dustwalker chariots
- Serpentmen cost adjustments
- "Lesser Lamia" theme for Amazon nations
- Full-sized illithid (mindblasters, elite/sacred soldiers, mages) added to illithid nations - these may be unbalanced in either direction
- Void gates are more common if a nation has a lot of units with void sanity, and much more common if they have units with summoning skill


0.6.20 (29th of December 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- If there are nation restrictions, a counter will indicate how many were rejected
- Fixed a (potential) problem with how chanceinc parses command-related arguments

Content

- Austral infantry is faster than normal, but austral cavalry shouldn't be
- Fixed temperature preferences for hot/cold serpentmen
- Fixed typo messing up rat and rabbit tribal themes for vaetti nations
- Fixed bad offset on boreal human ghouls
- Made some "big guy" poses (among others) more likely to be picked when making heros
- Fish, horse, grub, rat, and elephant heads for size-3 foulspawn
- Formorian stat update to Dom4 standards; better stats for the little ones, but pricier
- Uncursed theme for fomorians, with accompanying two-eyed giants and little not-goat-heads
- Fir bolgs as a standalone race, although they'll be more common as a secondary race (poor fir bolgs)
- Austral theme for primates (markata/bandar/bandar colossi); yeti got a few extra things as well
- Initial limited implementation of hoburg giants (giant hoburgs?) as monsters for feral hoburgs. Probably totally unbalanced.


0.6.19 (18th of October 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Magic weapons weren't being stored in the weapon DB during generation, leading to weirdness
- Several new failsafes added for commander gen and naming that fix rare crashes
- Montag units could potentially use up all unit ids in very large mods

Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a number of non-crash bugs involving typos, oversights, and missing files; thanks to everyone who reported them
- Brown and red muuch shamblers and demographic themes
- Feather-bedecked cavemen mounts for occidental hoburgs
- Certain varieties of charioteers can have whips for weapons
- Tengu roster size fix
- A handful of new troop descriptions, sacred troop names, and national epithets
- Strabo's serpentmen added as a minor race. Visually they're based on lesser hydras, mechanically on herbivore lizards. There was a fair amount of clutter added onto the mostly-done race base Strabo provided, primarily in adding demographic and regional variations. Nonetheless, they're a bit flat with only infantry, scouts, and casters, and they may possibly be unbalanced as well. Archers, chariots, and more variety for mages would make for good additions at some point down the line.


0.6.18 (12th of September 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------

Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- A few more body parts for size-3 Foulspawn
- Recruitable ghoul infantry for boreal nations (human or hoburg) with death magic
- A few shapeshift restrictions: undead casters/troops cannot have ghoul secondshapes, size-1 casters cannot have cave crab or great bear secondshapes, size-4+ mages cannot have winged monkey secondshapes, and Atlantians/muuch/size-4+ mages cannot have deep one secondshapes (pooramphibians/amphibians in general are also more/less likely to have them)
- Nazca-style robes for Caelians and occidental hoburgs
- Poison/flaming/banefire weapons for dustwalker ranged troops, as well as limiting their melee weapons to the heavier one-handers; this may or may not balance out the high prices for lightly-armed archers
- Activated the austral and humanbred elephant variants that have been around forever but not used
- Added dynastic human elephant variants
- Some graphic minor fixes


0.6.17c (23rd of August 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug where commander versions of units, mostly foul spawn, wouldn't follow equipment-affecting modifiers
- Tweaked commander selection criteria to prioritize units that fill many of the commands that should be filled at once
- Tweaked commander leadership assignment so that animals/slaves may have reduced leadership/inspiration, offset by an increased chance for beastmaster/taskmaster
- Tweaked commander leadership assignment so "non-standard" leaders are more likely to get more and better leadership, and "normals" are slightly less likely
- Tweaked mage/priest leadership for units derived from "warrior-priest" archtypes
- Nation ids were handed to nations discarded by seeds. 
	- Many mods with strict restrictions were unplayable even if they had just a few nations due to nation ids being higher than the game allows.

Content
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- The .jar was compiled from earlier codebase or something else really weird happened.


0.6.16b (17th of July 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Foul spawn centaur graphics were generated completely wrongly
- Item dependencies are reset when original item is removed
	- For example: Archers generally get quivers with their bows. If the bow is for some reason removed, so is the quiver.
	- Mostly there to hopefully fix a fairly rare commander overlay bug: Item removal or replacement in general are fairly rare


0.6.16 (17th of July 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Shapeshifts aren't horribly bugged anymore

- Blood magic is a bit more expensive
- A few size 1 shapeshifts for size 1 beings

Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- Reanimation on priests tends to not result on higher average priest level

- Basic commandline options for people who want to run an endless loop of NationGen nation batches to find their dream nation or something equally silly. See the documentation.

0.6.0 (17th of July 2015)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
-------------------
- A pile of seed-affecting options are now available. They give an options 0"seed" that can copied easily to sync options with other people.
- Mage and priest special ability generation rewritten. The distribution of stuff is different now.
- Theme system: Races get random themes and you might end up with something like oriental advanced hoburgs or primitive slaver lizards. For most races there are just few themes with moderate to little effect. However, see content part.
- Preview drawing is back (but does have some limitations like now showing #copystatted special monsters, so do note that)
- Troop generation overhaul
- Troop themes: Similar to old rare troop templates but able to affect unit generation instead of being given to units afterwards. These allow stuff like militia, minor elites etc and are far more common than the old troop templates. Every nation should get at least one.

- Monsters support custom sprites
- Troop and commander naming was entirely rewritten
- A good pile of new #chanceincs for content creation

- Forts moved to a file for ability to affect their probabilities
- Hero gold costs are now zero
- Heroes shouldn't get chaos recruitment and similar stuff
- Fixed a bug where only the last #chanceinc per thing was applied. This changed massively on how some things are generated.
- Nation filters are a bit more common
- A lot of tweaking and bugfixes

Content
-------------------
- New race: Minotaurs

- Several new filters for mages and troops; imposed some common sense restrictions on some of the shapechanging filters
- Slavery is more widespear (if rare for most races)
- More nation filters
- Other more or less minor additions

According to github there has been net of 9990 lines of code and content definitions (probably more definitions than code) added between June 13 and July 13. Last version of the program was released at the end of May so this is not even everything. To give credit where it's due, pretty much all the content additions apart from some of the troop and commander name files have been made by Ealb. While I've written most of the new code, Ealb has written a lot of bugfixes and tweaks and even more importantly spotted a huge number of bugs that may have been there for years.

Hoburgs are really worth checking out now. They really got a great amount of love from Ealb and are even more amazing now than before.
