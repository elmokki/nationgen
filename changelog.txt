0.6.23 (17th of July 2017)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed Zotz description misspecification causing crashes
- Fixed a minor bug that resulted in some units such as minotaurs getting only partial descriptions.
- Fixed a bug that occasionally prevented primary race-inherited commands such as fire resistance to secondary races of Abysian nations from being printed to .dm

0.6.22 (17th of July 2017)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- A huge pile of refactoring and optimization, by Freykin
- Added handling for #specifiedgcost and #specifieddescr to monster definitions
- Added handling for #additionalweaponslot to troop (not caster) pose definitions; this is much like #generateitem, but it happens late in generation and is less likely to be overridden
- Better unit finalizing for montag units
- Another round of double lance fixes
- Extra mages more common
- Montag PD support 


Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- Countless dumb typos and oversights fixed

- Giant feral hoburg monsters had neither shadows nor gcosts nor descriptions
- Bean sidhe, plus themes allowing sidhe nations to be either patriarchal (daoine sidhe), matriarchal (bean sidhe), or mixed (both men and women of the mounds)
- Some new Ysian shields for standard shieldsets as well as for sidhe and amazons
- Pygmy elephants and mammoths for hoburgs and vaettir, with regional variants

- Fixed overeating nephilim (1200/mo -> 120/mo)
- Cavalry/chariots no longer have feet slots, nor do serpentmen or purebred illithids
- New unit filters: growthpower, airshield, and overcharged for sacreds; airshield for mages
- A bunch of new flag graphics contributed by AlStar
- A miniscule number of other flag graphics
- Faster (giant) swan chariots
- Stray pixels on small pale one shadows should finally be gone
- Ancient pale one graphics cleaned up a bit
- Steel gear for ancient pale ones
- Ancient olmspawn
- Techlevel and cultural decay themes for pale ones
- Gold-recruitable cavern wights for pale one cultures whose birthrates have fallen too low (or mortality rates have grown too high); may be horribly unbalanced

- Filters for reduced/increased mage/elite/sacred costs
- Filter for Bloodguard-style berserking strong homesick elites, with fancy specific names
- "Troglotyid" cavefishmen demographic theme for ichtyids
- Nagas added as a full race; note that (for now) these are humble nagas w/o leg envy, so their mages don't shapechange





0.6.21c (25th of January 2017)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed melee javelins and some other magic item weirdness

0.6.21b (24th of January 2017)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- A change to mage leadership pricing made mages super cheap. This revealed a slightly more widespread bug in how command arguments were handled.
- Nations should no longer get two or more nation themes of the same type (for example, cheaper AND more expensive temples)


0.6.21 (24th of January 2017)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------

- Reclimit on dustwalker chariots
- Serpentmen cost adjustments
- "Lesser Lamia" theme for Amazon nations
- Full-sized illithid (mindblasters, elite/sacred soldiers, mages) added to illithid nations - these may be unbalanced in either direction
- Void gates are more common if a nation has a lot of units with void sanity, and much more common if they have units with summoning skill


0.6.20 (29th of December 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- If there are nation restrictions, a counter will indicate how many were rejected
- Fixed a (potential) problem with how chanceinc parses command-related arguments

Content

- Fixed temperature preferences for hot/cold serpentmen
- Fixed typo messing up rat and rabbit tribal themes for vaetti nations
- Fixed bad offset on boreal human ghouls
- Made some "big guy" poses (among others) more likely to be picked when making heros
- Fish, horse, grub, rat, and elephant heads for size-3 foulspawn
- Formorian stat update to Dom4 standards; better stats for the little ones, but pricier
- Uncursed theme for fomorians, with accompanying two-eyed giants and little not-goat-heads
- Fir bolgs as a standalone race, although they'll be more common as a secondary race (poor fir bolgs)
- Austral theme for primates (markata/bandar/bandar colossi); yeti got a few extra things as well
- Initial limited implementation of hoburg giants (giant hoburgs?) as monsters for feral hoburgs. Probably totally unbalanced.


0.6.19 (18th of October 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------
Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Magic weapons weren't being stored in the weapon DB during generation, leading to weirdness
- Several new failsafes added for commander gen and naming that fix rare crashes
- Montag units could potentially use up all unit ids in very large mods

Content
----------------------------------------------------------

- Brown and red muuch shamblers and demographic themes
- Feather-bedecked cavemen mounts for occidental hoburgs
- Certain varieties of charioteers can have whips for weapons
- Tengu roster size fix
- A handful of new troop descriptions, sacred troop names, and national epithets
- Strabo's serpentmen added as a minor race. Visually they're based on lesser hydras, mechanically on herbivore lizards. There was a fair amount of clutter added onto the mostly-done race base Strabo provided, primarily in adding demographic and regional variations. Nonetheless, they're a bit flat with only infantry, scouts, and casters, and they may possibly be unbalanced as well. Archers, chariots, and more variety for mages would make for good additions at some point down the line.


0.6.18 (12th of September 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------

Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- A few more body parts for size-3 Foulspawn
- Recruitable ghoul infantry for boreal nations (human or hoburg) with death magic
- A few shapeshift restrictions: undead casters/troops cannot have ghoul secondshapes, size-1 casters cannot have cave crab or great bear secondshapes, size-4+ mages cannot have winged monkey secondshapes, and Atlantians/muuch/size-4+ mages cannot have deep one secondshapes (pooramphibians/amphibians in general are also more/less likely to have them)
- Nazca-style robes for Caelians and occidental hoburgs
- Poison/flaming/banefire weapons for dustwalker ranged troops, as well as limiting their melee weapons to the heavier one-handers; this may or may not balance out the high prices for lightly-armed archers
- Activated the austral and humanbred elephant variants that have been around forever but not used
- Added dynastic human elephant variants
- Some graphic minor fixes


0.6.17c (23rd of August 2016)

----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug where commander versions of units, mostly foul spawn, wouldn't follow equipment-affecting modifiers
- Tweaked commander selection criteria to prioritize units that fill many of the commands that should be filled at once
- Tweaked commander leadership assignment so that animals/slaves may have reduced leadership/inspiration, offset by an increased chance for beastmaster/taskmaster
- Tweaked commander leadership assignment so "non-standard" leaders are more likely to get more and better leadership, and "normals" are slightly less likely
- Tweaked mage/priest leadership for units derived from "warrior-priest" archtypes
- Nation ids were handed to nations discarded by seeds. 
	- Many mods with strict restrictions were unplayable even if they had just a few nations due to nation ids being higher than the game allows.
- Fixed a bug where Foulspawn units had erratic amounts of item slots not always corresponding to how many and which limbs they had

Content
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- The .jar was compiled from earlier codebase or something else really weird happened.


0.6.16b (17th of July 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------
- Foul spawn centaur graphics were generated completely wrongly
- Item dependencies are reset when original item is removed
	- For example: Archers generally get quivers with their bows. If the bow is for some reason removed, so is the quiver.
	- Mostly there to hopefully fix a fairly rare commander overlay bug: Item removal or replacement in general are fairly rare


0.6.16 (17th of July 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
----------------------------------------------------------

Content
----------------------------------------------------------
- Reanimation on priests tends to not result on higher average priest level

- National spells

Code

- Performance tweaks (that are more than easily counteracted by how heavy foul spawn nations are to generate)
- Basic commandline options for people who want to run an endless loop of NationGen nation batches to find their dream nation or something equally silly. See the documentation.

- Fewer eyes for Fomorian giants
- Longdead chariots for dynastics
- Default theme for nations w/o explicit themesets is now a "techlevel" theme with tendencies to iron over bronze

- Clan-based Caelian pacyderm variants
- Gear overhaul for Caelians
- Fomorian gear split into bronze and iron
- "Dynastic" humans: living equivilant of dustwalkers, plus also undead dustwalkers too (they seem thoroughly materialistic in their desire to rebuild their ancient nations, so I see no problem with them operating on a gold economy)

- Random other stuff: a robe here, a name there, etc.

0.6.0 (17th of July 2015)
----------------------------------------------------------

Code
-------------------
- A pile of seed-affecting options are now available. They give an options 0"seed" that can copied easily to sync options with other people.
- Mage and priest special ability generation rewritten. The distribution of stuff is different now.
- Theme system: Races get random themes and you might end up with something like oriental advanced hoburgs or primitive slaver lizards. For most races there are just few themes with moderate to little effect. However, see content part.
- Preview drawing is back (but does have some limitations like now showing #copystatted special monsters, so do note that)
- Troop generation overhaul
- Troop themes: Similar to old rare troop templates but able to affect unit generation instead of being given to units afterwards. These allow stuff like militia, minor elites etc and are far more common than the old troop templates. Every nation should get at least one.
- Support for mage/sacred/etc themes for future ideas of random templates for those
- Monsters support custom sprites
- Troop and commander naming was entirely rewritten
- A good pile of new #chanceincs for content creation
- Documentation on some things has been updated
- Forts moved to a file for ability to affect their probabilities
- Hero gold costs are now zero
- Heroes shouldn't get chaos recruitment and similar stuff
- Fixed a bug where only the last #chanceinc per thing was applied. This changed massively on how some things are generated.
- Nation filters are a bit more common
- A lot of tweaking and bugfixes

Content
-------------------
- New race: Minotaurs
- Slaver variants of races merged into normal race with use of themes

- Added several possible melee weapons for ranged units and restricted non-elite ranged units from getting strong melee weapons
- Distinct nation names for advanced humans
- Several miscellaneous new mounts added to various races (small bears, black dogs, etc.)
- Several new filters for mages and troops; imposed some common sense restrictions on some of the shapechanging filters
- Slavery is more widespear (if rare for most races)
- More nation filters
- Other more or less minor additions

According to github there has been net of 9990 lines of code and content definitions (probably more definitions than code) added between June 13 and July 13. Last version of the program was released at the end of May so this is not even everything. To give credit where it's due, pretty much all the content additions apart from some of the troop and commander name files have been made by Ealb. While I've written most of the new code, Ealb has written a lot of bugfixes and tweaks and even more importantly spotted a huge number of bugs that may have been there for years.

Hoburgs are really worth checking out now. They really got a great amount of love from Ealb and are even more amazing now than before.
