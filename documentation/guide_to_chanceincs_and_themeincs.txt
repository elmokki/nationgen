Basics
-----------------------------------
Chanceincs and themeincs both modify the probability distributions for generation. Chanceincs do it by modifying the probability
of the entity it is written on while themeincs modify it for everything else when the entity it is on has been selected. In terms 
of syntax, the only difference is that chanceincs start with #chanceinc and themeincs with #themeinc. The following examples will 
use #chanceinc.

To use a chanceinc your syntax is #chanceinc <chanceinc> <modifier>. Chanceincs can be found in the list below, let us use the first
one for example. Modifiers determine how the weight of an item is modified: Modifier of 2 changes the weight to 2, modifier of +2 adds
2 to the weight, modifier of *2 doubles the weight and so on. If we wanted to increase the weight of an entity, for example
a certain shapeshift filter, for lizards by 100%, we would write:

#chanceinc race lizard *2

If we wanted to do this for all races except oriental humans, we would write:

#chanceinc not race "Oriental human" *2

The not-modifier is optional, signified by [square brackets] in documentation and generally negates the outcome. The quotation marks for the race
are used to signify that Oriental human is a single argument rather than Oriental and human being separate arguments. This is generally required
almost solely for some races.


Logical operators
-----------------------------------
As of 0.7.0-RC2 there is support for logical operators, allowing more complexity to chanceincs and themeincs. The simplest of these is the NOT-operator
in the example above. Generally you have to put the operator in a specified place in the chanceinc for it to work, usually but not always as the first argument.
For the NOT-operator you should look at the documentation.

The more general operators are AND and OR. These should be fairly clear to any programmer, but simply put they allow you to tie things together. For example,
if we want to double the weight of an entity if the race of the unit choosing it is either lizard or human, we could write:

#chanceinc race human OR race lizard *2

Alternatively, we could, for example, make a lizard flag part available to any nation that either has lizards as primary race or has a theme "serpent cult":

#chanceinc primaryrace lizard OR hastheme "serpent cult" *2

As for AND, if we wanted an unit to be lizard AND have flying, we could write:

#chanceinc race lizard AND personalcommand flying *2

These can also be chained, for example:

#chanceinc primaryrace lizard OR hastheme "serpent cult" AND race lizard *2

The operators are read from left to right. For example, if we have true OR false AND true, it is processed as follows:
1. (true OR false) AND true
2. (true AND true)
3. true

If you wish to change the processing order, you can add parentheses, for example: 
#chanceinc primaryrace lizard OR (hastheme "serpent cult" AND race lizard) *2

Unit-based chanceincs
-----------------------------------
Unit-based chanceincs require an unit to be in the scope of chanceinc. These tend to be in items or filters for units and such.

Race:		race <race>
		True if unit is of given race
Pose: 		pose <pose role>
		True if unit pose supports given role (ranged/infantry/cavalry/chariot)
Command:	personalcommand <command> [below/above/not] [command value]
		True if command exists or if a value is defined, is above/below/precisely the value
Second shape:	personalshape <shape name>
		True if unit has second shape of given name
Filter:		filter <filter name>
		True if unit has a filter of given name
Tag:		unittag <tag>
		True if unit (including stuff it contains, poses, filters etc) has given tag
		Alternative call of #tag is supported.
Race tag:	#racetag [not] <tag>
		True if unit's race has given tag
Unit theme:	unittheme <theme>
		True if unit (including stuff it contains, poses, filters etc) has given theme tag (defined by #theme)
Race theme:	racetheme <theme>
		True if unit's race has a racial theme of given name or contains given theme tag
Pose tag:	posetag  <tag>
		True if unit's pose has given tag
Pose theme:	posetheme <theme>
		True if unit's theme has given theme tag
Slot id:	slot <slot> [not] [armor/weapon] <id>
		True if given slot of unit is filled with something. Leave id out for any id, add armor/weapon to limit checking to armor/weapon. 
		Leave both out to check if there is anything in the slot. Id check should also check for the id a magic weapon of a sacred is based on.
Slot name:	slotname <slot> [not] [armor/weapon] <name>
		As above but looks for item names (as defined in NationGen, not in game)
Slot tag:	slottag <slot> [not] <tag>
		True if item in given slot contains given tag
Slot tag value:	slottag <slot> [not] <tag> <value>
		True if item in given slot contains given tag that has a value (#tag animal horse is tag "animal" with value "horse")
Item tag:	itemtag <tag>
		True if any item an unit is wearing has given tag
Item theme:	itemtheme <theme>
		As above but for theme tags
Pose itm theme:	poseitemtheme <slot> <theme>
		True if unit's pose has items of given slot that have given theme tag
Tagged magic:	taggedmagic [not] <path1> [path2] [path3]...
		True if unit has been tagged with magic of given path or paths. This is supposed to be used with items and filters that have
		"#path <path>" defined in them. Used for some sacred naming stuff, probably.
Compare magic:	comparemagic <path1> [not] [above/below] <path2>
		True if path1 is above/below/equal to path2 on given unit.
Magic levels:	personalmagic <path> [below] <level>	
		If the unit has magic path <path> at least/below <level>, true.
		You can add multiple <path> [below] <level> sequences before <mod> for multiple
		checks.	
Original name:	origname <name>
		Checks unit base name (ie for Hammer Soldier it is Soldier). This is used for sacred commander naming.
Protection:	prot [below] <value>
		Checks if unit protection is at least given value. Generation order matters: Before getting armor an unit has less prot.
Encumberance:	enc [below] <value>
		As above but for encumberance. Generation order matters: Before getting armor an unit has less enc.


Nation-based chanceincs
-----------------------------------
Nation-based chanceincs are always checked and contain nation-level aggregate statistics and nation-specific features.

Themeincs
-----------------------------------
While chanceincs modify probabilities of the entities they are written on, themeincs are added to units and/or nations and affect probabilities 
of other entities, should they fill the conditions: For example, a chanceinc on a sword might decrease the probability of it being generated for an UW nation
while a themeinc on UW nation might decrease probability of all UW-unsuitable weapons with a single command.

Theme:		theme [not] <theme>
		True if the entity has a theme tag (#theme foo) specified.
