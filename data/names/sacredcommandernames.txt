--- Supported chanceincs:
---
--- personalmagic <path> <pathlevel> <chance change>
--- Each line can have multiple path-level combos that are required to get the change. Number after path signifies required path level.
--- In general the unit must have the signified path level to get the name.
--- The base chance is multiplied by the average path level of the paths the unit has.
--- Example: Mage with F2 and E2 and "personalmagic fire 1 earth 1 1" gets (2 + 2) / 2 = 2 times the chance increase.
---
--- magicbelow  <path> <pathlevel> <chance change>
--- Same as above, but it triggers if the unit has a magic level that is under the specified value. Good for making the most epic names not happen on tertiaries etc.
--- Does not get the base chance multiplying however.
---
--- race <race name> <chance change>
--- Should be fairly self explaining: checks unit's race.
---
--- pose <pose type> <chance change>
--- Same as above, but makes sure unit's pose can be used for given role (infantry, mounted, ranged, scout, sacred, mage, priest, chariot)
--- Not generally useful for mage/priest name separation (use magicbelow and magic for that) due to them often using same poses, but can be useful for sacred names.
---
--- command <command> <chance change>
--- Checks if the unit has given command with any argument. For example "command #stealthy 1" name gets +1 chance of being picked when the unit has stealth of any level.
---
--- origname <name> <chance change>
--- Designed for sacred commander naming. If a sacred is named Thunderous Templar, "origname Templar 1" gets +1 chance of being picked when making commander version 
--- of that sacred.
---
--- magic <path> <chance change>
--- Purely for sacreds. National magic and sacred equipment dictate what path the sacred is - this triggers on that.
---
--- filter <name> <chance change>
--- If filter named <name> was applied to the unit, this triggers.
