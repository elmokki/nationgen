--- Usable special stuff that may be badly documented
--
-- #pose role/name <thing>
-- Uses poses of <thing> name or role
--
-- #requiredposetag <tag>
-- #requiredposetheme <theme>
-- Excludes poses without this tag/theme
--
-- #equipmenttargettag <tag>
-- Equipment will have to have this tag when it is available. 
-- This is for "tier 1-3" for mage/priest type poses, but themeincs work well as well.
--
-- #troop
-- This is a troop instead of commander (I'm looking at you, communion slave)
--
-- Extra tip: #generateitem works here like it should in all filters/equipment
-- Extra tip: Special commanders get #poorleader or #noleader if nothing is specified
